# if you use nginx with custom path, use this to override links
#url_prefix: https://dev.company.local/sinopia/

# You can specify listen address (or simply a port).
# If you add multiple values, sinopia will listen on all of them.
#
# Examples:
#
#listen:
# - localhost:4873            # default value
# - http://localhost:4873     # same thing
# - 0.0.0.0:4873              # listen on all addresses (INADDR_ANY)
# - https://example.org:4873  # if you want to use https
# - [::1]:4873                # ipv6
# - unix:/tmp/sinopia.sock    # unix socket

# Configure HTTPS, it is required if you use "https" protocol above.
#https:
#  key: path/to/server.key
#  cert: path/to/server.crt

# type: file | stdout | stderr
# level: trace | debug | info | http (default) | warn | error | fatal
#
# parameters for file: name is filename
#  {type: 'file', path: 'sinopia.log', level: 'debug'},
#
# parameters for stdout and stderr: format: json | pretty
#  {type: 'stdout', format: 'pretty', level: 'debug'},
logs:
  - {type: stdout, format: pretty, level: http}
  #- {type: file, path: sinopia.log, level: info}

# you can specify proxy used with all requests in wget-like manner here
# (or set up ENV variables with the same name)
#http_proxy: http://something.local/
#https_proxy: https://something.local/
#no_proxy: localhost,127.0.0.1

# maximum size of uploaded json document
# increase it if you have "request entity too large" errors
#max_body_size: 1mb
