# You can specify listen address (or simply a port).
# If you add multiple values, verdaccio will listen on all of them.
#
# Examples:
#
#listen:
# - localhost:4873            # default value
# - http://localhost:4873     # same thing
# - 0.0.0.0:4873              # listen on all addresses (INADDR_ANY)
# - https://example.org:4873  # if you want to use https
# - [::1]:4873                # ipv6
# - unix:/tmp/verdaccio.sock    # unix socket

# Configure HTTPS, it is required if you use "https" protocol above.
#https:
#  key: path/to/server.key
#  cert: path/to/server.crt

# type: file | stdout | stderr
# level: trace | debug | info | http (default) | warn | error | fatal
#
# parameters for file: name is filename
#  {type: 'file', path: 'verdaccio.log', level: 'debug'},
#
# parameters for stdout and stderr: format: json | pretty | pretty-timestamped
#  {type: 'stdout', format: 'pretty', level: 'debug'},
logs:
  - {type: stdout, format: pretty, level: http}
  #- {type: file, path: verdaccio.log, level: info}

# you can specify proxy used with all requests in wget-like manner here
# (or set up ENV variables with the same name)
#http_proxy: http://something.local/
#https_proxy: https://something.local/
#no_proxy: localhost,127.0.0.1

# maximum size of uploaded json document
# increase it if you have "request entity too large" errors
#max_body_size: 1mb

# Notify Settings
# Notify was built primarily to use with Slack's Incoming
# webhooks, but will also deliver a simple payload to
# any endpoint. Currently only active for publish / create
# commands.
notify:
  # Choose a method. Technically this will accept any HTTP
  # request method, but probably stick to GET or POST
  method: POST
  # If this endpoint requires specific headers, set them here
  # as an array of key: value objects.
  headers: [{'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}]
  # set the URL endpoint for this call
  endpoint: https://hooks.slack.com/...
  # Finally, the content you will be sending in the body.
  # This data will first be run through Handlebars to parse
  # any Handlebar expressions. All data housed in the metadata object
  # is available for use within the expressions.
  content: ' {{ handlebar-expression }}'
  # For Slack, follow the following format:
  # content: '{ "text": "Package *{{ name }}* published to version *{{ dist-tags.latest }}*", "username": "Verdaccio", "icon_emoji": ":package:" }'
